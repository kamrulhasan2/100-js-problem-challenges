## üìå Introduction

This repository consists of 100 carefully designed JavaScript challenges to help you practice logical thinking, algorithmic approaches, and language fundamentals. Each challenge focuses on a particular concept or use-case, from basic string manipulation to recursion, array operations, and more.

---

## üíæ Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local 
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-js-problem-challenges.git
    cd 100-js-problem-challenges`
    
2. No external dependencies are required. You can run the problem solutions in any modern JavaScript environment, such as:
    - Node.js
    - Browser Console
    - Online Editors (e.g., JSFiddle, CodePen, Replit)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Each question is written with a descriptive comment block. You can navigate through the `.js` file or split each problem into separate files for better organization.

You can test your solutions by running the main file:

Bash

`node index.js`

Alternatively, test individual functions in your preferred code editor or browser console.
